## Backtracking Algorithm
This algorithm starts from the leftmost column and attempts to place a queen in the first row. If it can it moves to the next column and attempts the place a queen in the first row, if it can't then it tries in the next row up. If there are no spots to place a queen in a column, then it backtracks and places the queen of the previous column in the next row up. It repeats this algorithm until it places N queens on the board
